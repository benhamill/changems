# Changems

On the [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com) podcast, [Nick Quaranto](http://quaran.to) (of [Gem Cutter](http://rubygems.org) fame) was talking about rubygems-related projects he'd like to see. He mentioned something about a web app that would do something with gems' change logs. I thought that sounded like an interesting idea.

## Road Map

Some ideas for features I'll be working towards. I'm open to other ideas. In no particular order:

- Search by gem name
- Gem pages with prettied-up, standardized-format change logs
- API end point to get the changes in a given release
- API end point to get the changes between 2 releases

## Help?

Oh please yes!

1. Fork it.
2. Feature branch.
3. Write test.
4. Make test pass.
5. Send pull request.
6. Have a beer.
