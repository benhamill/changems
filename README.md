# Changems

On the [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com) podcast, [Nick Quaranto](http://quaran.to) (of [Gem Cutter](http://rubygems.org) fame) was talking about rubygems-related projects he'd like to see. He mentioned something about a web app that would do something with gems' change logs. I thought that sounded like an interesting idea.
